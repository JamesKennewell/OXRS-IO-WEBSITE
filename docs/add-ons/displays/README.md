# Displays

Sometimes you need visual representation of information to interact with a system. Great way to do that is with a display. The OXRS system is building up a repertoire of displays for various uses and hopefully one of them will meet your needs.


Displays:
- [1.54" 240x240 IPS](/add-ons/displays/IPS-display.md)
- [0.91" 128x32 OLED](/add-ons/displays/128x32-OLED-display.md)
